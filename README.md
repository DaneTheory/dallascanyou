# About

My roommates and I frequently ask my roommate Dallas to do things. We decided it would be funny to create "Dallas as a Service". The app currently lives at [DallasCanYou.com](http://dallascanyou.com/) and is hosted on Heroku. Facebook authentication is used to prevent abuse. The Twilio API is used to send the text messages. Python with Flask is used for the backend and MongoDB is used for storage.
